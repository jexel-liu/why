Welcome to my Challenge. <br>
<br>
Let's get some things straight. <br>
<br>
1): None of the websites that I take you to contains anything malicious <br>
<br>
2): You will recieve an amazon gift carf of 20$ or a steam gift card of 25$ for finishing this puzzle. There can only be one winner. <br>
<br>
<!-- 3): I did not pave a concrete path for you to solve this puzzle, many things are hidden, riddled, or something else. I'd say its a bit easier than Siceth's if you were a good student in school) -->
<br>
4): Nothing put above is legally binding, please don't... wait no. You cannot sue me.<br>
<br>
5): I have the right not to give the gift card to somebody in the case that they were suspected of cheating, just remember that... <br>
<br>

At this point, if you reached this website, you are either a): snooping through my school github (please don't do this) <br>
or b): skipped a step, which I'm assuming most of you did. Remember 16? or should I say 4 x 4. Remember the discord logo? remember the hid... wait, you skipped over that one???? How could you have done that?! <br>
How do you expect to complete a puzzle when you can't even find everything on my profile? <br>
Think of my profile as a compiler. It tells you the materials you need and how to put it together, you just have to know where to find those materials. <br>
You know, I do like the Matrix. However, people made some strange faces at me when I asked them what the matrix movie was. I didn't know they made a movie for that!? <br>
Who would ever watch something like that??? like how would there be action or anything when its all on pen and paper???
